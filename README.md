# Starlight express: _super compact web applications roadmap for speed freaks_

The rationale is that,
- Internet courses will teach you to use frameworks and libraries just as they are - which can already get you a job (:moneybag:).

- University will teach you the fundamental concepts and techniques behind all these "black boxes". Then you can troubleshoot, optimize, and do more advanced things to solve novel and more challenging problems - which makes you very valuable engineers that companies fight for (:moneybag::moneybag::moneybag:).

The best strategy, is to **do both!**

Since you already have to deal with university workload, this guide is intended to be an extremely concise roadmap - no BS, straight to the point. 

The steps to hit the ground running are simply three:  

:globe_with_meridians: **HTML+CSS**  -> :electron: **Frontend framework**  -> :floppy_disk: **Backend framework + Database**

Good luck.
